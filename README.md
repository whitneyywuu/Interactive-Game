Game Concept: The game begins when Button A is pressed, triggering a green NeoPixel flash and a beep. During gameplay, a random LED lights up in red, blue, or yellow. The player must respond correctly—press Button A for red, Button B for blue, or shake the board for yellow—within 1.5 seconds. Correct responses earn a point and play a happy sound, while incorrect or delayed actions trigger a buzz and no points. The game has three levels: Easy (1.5s delay), Medium (1.0s), and Hard (0.5s with sound distractions), advancing after every 5 correct responses. The game ends after 3 mistakes, playing a sad sound and displaying the final score on the NeoPixel ring. Players can restart the game by pressing Button A.
